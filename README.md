# Solid Budget

Based off the same principles as [Budget Dash](http://github.com/kjintroverted/budget-dash), this is a budgeting tool designed to help you understand where your money is allocated and going on a monthly or yearly basis. The idea is to make sure every dollar has a job and that you know what those jobs are to better plan your finances. 

This app utilizes a React front end and uses Solid PODs for auth and data.

## Solid PODs

All data for this app is stored in [Solid PODs](https://solid.inrupt.com/how-it-works). Before you begin using the app or developing you will need to [register for a pod](https://solid.inrupt.com/get-a-solid-pod).

Your POD will be your login and your data store for the app.
